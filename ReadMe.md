As outlined in my [original reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/disabledgamers/comments/1dtnl4d/concept_the_omnicontroller/), this is an early work-in-progress for an all-in-one customizable and programmable input system, with a focus on accessibility and interoperability. It aims to standardize an easy-to-implement communication protocol between custom hardware and this application, which will act as a controller, mouse, and/or keyboard for use with a desktop computer, and hopefully a mobile device as well. It aims to be usable as a standalone customizable touch-based controller as well.

Greater details to come later - many written plans exist already on a technical and conceptual level, but they are subject to change during this very early development period.
